This is a demo application type.

- See the [.application.ts](https://bit.cloud/learnbit/apps/custom-app-type/node-app-type/~code/node-app-type.application.ts) file to learn how to implement the app-type's core functionality (`bit run APP_NAME` and `bit build APP_COMPONENT_ID`).
- See the [.app-type.ts](https://bit.cloud/learnbit/apps/custom-app-type/node-app-type/~code/node-app-type.app-type.ts) file to learn how to define the properties configurable by this app-type's plugin file.
- See the [.main.runtime.ts](https://bit.cloud/learnbit/apps/custom-app-type/node-app-type/~code/node-app-type.main.runtime.ts) file to learn how to register an app-type and define its plugin file extension.

This app type does not implement its own deploy function. To learn how to implement your own deployer or to use an existing one, see ['App deployment'](https://bit.dev/docs/apps/app-deployment).

Run the following to import this app-type and configure it on your workspace:

```bash
bit import learnbit.apps/custom-app-type/node-app-type
bit use learnbit.apps/custom-app-type/node-app-type
```

Run the following to run a demo app that uses this app-type:

```bash
bit import learnbit.app/custom-app-type/my-app
bit use learnbit.app/custom-app-type/my-app
```
