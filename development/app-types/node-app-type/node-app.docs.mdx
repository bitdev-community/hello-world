# What's included

- See the [node-app.application.ts](https://bit.cloud/greetings/app-types/node-app-type/~code/node-app.application.ts) file to learn how to implement the app-type's core functionality.
- See the [node-app.app-type.ts](https://bit.cloud/greetings/app-types/node-app-type/~code/node-app.app-type.ts) file to learn how to define the properties configurable by this app-type's plugin file.
- See the [node-app-options.ts](https://bit.cloud/greetings/app-types/node-app-type/~code/node-app-optinos.ts) file to learn how to register an app-type and define its plugin file extension.

This app type does not implement its own deploy function. 
To learn how to implement your own deployer or to use an existing one, see ['App deployment'](https://bit.dev/docs/apps/app-deployment).

# Adding the app type to your workspace
Run the following to import this app-type to your workspace

```bash
bit import greetings.hello-world/app-types/node-app-type 
bit use greetings.hello-world/app-types/node-app-type
```

or install it using `bit install`
# Use it in your Env
You need to register the new app type inside your Env.

```
import { NodeAppType } from '@greetings/development.app-types.node-app-type';

export class MyNodeEnv extends NodeEnv {
  /* shorthand name for the environment */
  name = 'my-node-env';

  /* register the new app  */
  apps(): EnvHandler<AppTypeList> {
    return AppTypeList.from([NodeAppType.from({})]);
  }
}
```
[Here](https://bit.cloud/greetings/development/envs/node-env/~code/node-env.bit-env.ts) is an example of defining the app type in an Env.


# Use the app-type in the application file extension
When creating an app using the app type you need to follow the following convension.

```
hello-world-api.node-bundled-app.cjs
```
**Note:** The application uses `node-bundled-app`

[Here](https://bit.cloud/greetings/hello-world/apps/hello-world-api/~code/hello-world-api.node-bundled-app.cjs) is an example of using the app type.
