# `Hello World` App Evolution
This repository will take you through the evolution of a basic hello-world application that incorporates React for the frontend (`/web`) and Express.js for the API (`/api`). Initially, the application follows a conventional React and Express.js architecture, but gradually evolves into an independent component architecture.

As you progress through the different stages of the transition, you'll find the code in corresponding branch in this repository.

## Pre-Bit
**Example:** [Code](https://github.com/teambit-community/hello-world/tree/pre-bit)

This branch contains a classical React frontend and an Express.js API. They are deployed to Netlify and to a Virtual Machine using SSH.
