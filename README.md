# "Hello World" App Evolution to Component DrDr
This repository shows the evolution of a simple hello-world app that uses React for frontend (`/web`) and Express.js (`/api`) for the API. First it is started two classical React and Express.js apps and evolved into independent component architecture. In each branch having the prefix `stage`, you can find different steps in the transition.

## Stage 1: Simple App
Branch: [view](https://github.com/teambit-community/hello-world/tree/stage1-simple_app)

Run Express.js API: Go to `/api` directory and execute `npm run start` command.

## Stage 2: Consuming the API
Branch: [view](https://github.com/teambit-community/hello-world/tree/stage2-consuming-api)

Run React App: Go to `/web` directory and execute `npm run start` command.
